# 1. INTRODUCTION
DeSimone Consulting Engineers (DCE) is a leading firm in the structural engineering, 
facade consulting, and forensic services industries. DCE provides a comprehensive range of 
services (Desimone, n.d.) for all types of buildings, with 14 offices in 4 countries and 
headquartered in New York City. DCE is highly regarded for its expertise in concrete engineering 
and for delivering high-quality engineering services for projects of varying sizes and complexity. 
Concrete is a vital composite material used in construction that consists of cement, water, 
and aggregates (such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone). Its importance lies in its strength, 
durability, and ability to withstand various environmental conditions. To test this, wet concrete 
samples are collected from construction sites, molded into a cylindrical shape (Fig. 1(a)), and are
then subjected to strength testing using a specialized machine that can apply a compressive load 
to the sample (Fig. 1(b)). The machine measures the force required to compress the sample, 
allowing engineers to determine the compression strength of the material. What sets this 
measurement apart is that it is not restricted or confined, allowing for lateral expansion while 
undergoing compression. As a result, this particular strength is referred to as unconfined 
compression strength. The reason for collecting these wet samples is to test their strength in the 
lab based on their location of placement, which is crucial for ensuring the structural integrity of 
the concrete.

The challenge DCE faces is that it collects an abundance of field concrete samples for 
determining unconfined compressive strength, creating a vast dataset. However, currently, DCE 
lacks an efficient system to effectively store, analyze and utilize this data. This data includes details
about the site, including city, project type, building height or number of floors, ambient 
temperature; details about the concrete used in the building, like concrete Mix ID, concrete 
temperature, structural element, location of placement, and water added; and details about the 
testing sample like unit weight, air content, slump, specimen size, and date tested. The contractor 
usually presents this data to DCE in PDF format, but there is currently no system in place to 
effectively process and make use of this information. This makes it challenging for a practicing 
structural engineer to find the predominant mix design for elements in a geographic area for 
specific building types and to understand the performance of high-strength mixes in hot and cold 
cycles. This information could help identify the most successful mixes and highlight any issues 
with mixes that have strength problems.

Currently, DCE's approach for collecting and analyzing this data includes obtaining readymix concrete loads from the contractor, collecting cylindrical modeled specimens, and sending 
them to the labs for testing the unconfined concrete strength for 56 days. The results of these tests 
are then sent to the DCE's shared drive, where the engineers review them manually, and make 
decisions accordingly. Despite collecting a vast dataset of field concrete samples for unconfined 
compressive strength, DCE currently lacks an efficient system for effectively analyzing and 
utilizing this data. This poses several challenges for engineers, such as difficulties in identifying 
suitable mix designs for specific building types and elements or determining which high-strength 
mixes are performing well or have strength issues. The current network-attached storage 
exacerbates the problem, making it challenging to locate and retrieve specific reports efficiently. 
Therefore, a formalized framework for data storage, retrieval, and analysis is urgently needed. 
Furthermore, DCE requires a machine learning model to predict concrete strength and understand 
how the key influencing factors affect it under real-world conditions, such as local temperature 
variations. A systematic approach to data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling is 
necessary to uncover meaningful insights and patterns.

# 2. METHODOLOGY

## 2.1. About the data
The dataset used in this project comprises of Unconfined Concrete Strength test results for 
each set of specimens from various construction sites, produced by testing agencies. The data is 
currently in PDF format and needs to be extracted. Reports produced by two independent testing 
agencies were used for this project, which contain essential details related to Site, Concrete and 
Test specimens collected from wet concrete mixtures. Since the current storage system hinders 
data analysis due to its nested directories on a network-attached storage system, there is a need for 
a structured data such as a clean Excel file that categorizes and minimizes data redundancy, 
facilitating easy retrieval and analysis for engineers. This structured data enables accurate 
predictions of Unconfined Concrete Strength.

## 2.2. Designed solution
To address these problems, a robust framework is implemented, consisting of two major 
components â€“ The Data Curation System and The Predictive System.
The Data Curation System is responsible for collecting, cleaning, and organizing the data 
for analysis. It involves scraping the data from PDF files, storing them in a structured tabular 
format, and integrating the data into a unified format before transferring them to Excel files. This 
ensures data integrity by eliminating redundancy and inconsistency. The Predictive System then 
utilizesthe curated data to develop predictive models using advanced machine learning algorithms, 
enabling DCE to accurately predict mix designs for engineering structures in specific temperature 
ranges and geographic areas.

## 2.3. Data curation system
The data curation system was developed in Python to extract and analyze the Unconfined 
Concrete Strength test data from PDF lab reports. This is accomplished through the utilization of 
text scraping techniques, using various Python libraries like Pypdfium2, Pdfplumber, Camelot and 
Tabula. These python libraries are implemented to scrape the data from different sections of the 
PDF document, including the header, footer, and body. This ensures that all relevant information 
is captured accurately and efficiently.

After extracting the necessary data from the PDF files, the next step is data cleaning. The 
Unconfined Concrete Strength test results are manually entered into the PDF format by the testing 
agencies, increasing the likelihood of errors such as incorrect field names and naming formats. To 
ensure data accuracy and integrity, the cleaning process includes the identification and correction 
of such errors. This is done using a series of conditions and codes that can also be used for future 
corrections. The cleaning process involves several stages, such as removing redundant data, filling 
in missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.
After completing the data cleaning process, the data is organized into multiple tables with 
predefined data schemas. Data schemas provide a structured framework for managing and 
organizing data within a data management system. They define field data types and establish 
relationships between tables by assigning primary keys and foreign keys. A primary key serves as 
a unique identifier for a record within a table, while a foreign key is a field in one table that 
references the primary key in another table, establishing connections and relationships between 
them. This ensures that the data is stored in a structured and organized format across different 
tables, making it easier for DCE engineers and analysts to extract valuable insights and draw 
conclusions from the data. The data curation system exports data into three clean data files:

### a. Project Information: 
This file is created by DCE analysts and contains information related 
to a project, such as the project name, building type, number of levels, height, address, site 
latitude and longitude etc.
### b. Specimen Field Report: 
This file includes field or site data, such as the site weather, 
concrete mix ID, concrete supplier, time of specimen molding, specimen temperature, 
specimen density, air content, required compression strength of the specimen, and other 
related data points.
### c. Specimen Compression Test Report: 
This file includes data related to the compression tests 
conducted by a testing agency, such as date of the test, specimen age in days, load at which 
the specimen broke, and other relevant data points.

This structured data is then utilized in the designing of a predictive system, which uses 
sophisticated machine learning techniques to create models that can accurately predict the 
Unconfined Concrete Strength of a concrete specimen.

## 2.4. Predictive system
Choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a given problem depends on several 
factors, such as the type of data, and the desired outcome. In this case, the obtained data is labeled, 
and therefore a supervised learning method is appropriate. Additionally, since the target attribute
to be predicted is a continuous numerical value, the problem falls into the category of regression.
After considering all the above factors, an artificial neural network model was chosen to
predict the Unconfined concrete strength with high accuracy and identify the key influencing 
factors that affect the concrete strength in real-world conditions such as variations in local 
temperature. This helps an engineer to make even better-informed decisions. The subsequent 
section provides a detailed description of the model and its specifications.

## 2.5 Artificial neural network
Neural networks are models inspired by the biological structure of the human brain, 
composed of processing units known as neurons. The strength of neural networks lies in their 
numerous interconnections and their ability to learn from data, which makes them powerful tools 
for prediction and classification. In this case, a neural network approach is chosen to address the 
complex relationships observed in the data between various variables such as Required Strength 
and Age-days, and their impact on the unconfined compressive strength (UCS).
In this project, a neural network was used, which consists of layers of neurons that are 
interconnected through weighted connections and biases. As shown in Fig 3, the first layer takes 
in the input data, and the last layer produces the output. The intermediate layers, known as hidden 
layers, perform computations on the data as it passes through the network. Each neuron has a 
weight that decides how important it is. In a feedforward neural network, the input data is passed 
through different layers of neurons, which extract features and produce a final output. The weights 
and biases of these connections are adjusted through the backpropagation algorithm, which 
involves computing the error between the predicted and actual output and propagating this error 
backwards through the network to adjust the weights and biases. This technique is particularly 
useful when the output is dependent on past inputs and when there is a feedback loop between the 
output and input layers.

Given the number of available data points, the optimal performance was observed in the 
neural network architecture with 4 hidden layers having 300, 200, 100, and 50 neurons
respectively. In order to prevent over-fitting, a simpler architecture was chosen, with regularization 
and dropout techniques implemented to further improve the model. Regularization, for instance, 
involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to limit model complexity, while dropout 
randomly removes neurons during training to avoid over-reliance on specific neurons. Specifically, 
the complete dataset was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set. Cross-validation was
then used to evaluate the performance of the model by training it on different combinations of data 
subsets. The best epoch was chosen based on low validation loss.
To investigate the factors influencing unconfined concrete strength, permutation 
importance was used to determine the most significant variables in a neural network model. 
Permutation importance is a method that measures the importance of each feature in a model by 
shuffling its values and observing the effect on the model's performance. It works by measuring 
how much the model's accuracy changes when each variable is randomly shuffled. The greater the 
change in accuracy, the more important the variable is considered to be in predicting the target 
variable. By analyzing these scores, the most significant variables in predicting unconfined 
concrete strength were identified as Specimen Age Days and Specimen Required Strength.
After training the neural network model with the chosen architecture, and hyperparameters, 
its performance was evaluated by measuring the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) between 
predicted and actual values of the unconfined concrete strength.

# 3. Result
## 3.1. Data Visualization and Interpretation

![image](https://github.com/ramgopalputta/Predictive_Model_For_Unconfined_Concrete_Strength/assets/114395443/9a3f783f-c8b4-47b5-afcf-5efa735791f1)

The model results in the RMSE value of 991, which means the predicted concrete strength 
value is off by +/-991 PSI.
The key influential variables are identified by the model. As illustrated in Figure 4, the top 
three influential features for predicting the measured concrete strength were found to be the batch 
required strength, the specimen age tested, and the batch temperature. This finding offers valuable 
insights into the key factors that impact concrete strength and can aid in enhancing quality control 
and optimizing the concrete production process.
In our study, we observed that the majority of specimens were tested on the 7th, 28th, and 
56th days. To investigate the relationship between the required strength and the measured strength 
on these days, we plotted the data and visualized the results as shown in Figure 5. The linear 
regression lines indicate the trend, while the blue ticks represent the mean ratio with each required 
strength, and the bars show one standard deviation from the means.

![image](https://github.com/ramgopalputta/Predictive_Model_For_Unconfined_Concrete_Strength/assets/114395443/052b3cd2-6883-45ef-9d1f-11af6ecf487e)

As depicted in Figure 5, on the seventh day, most specimens exhibited measured strengths 
that were close to but slightly lower than the required strength, except for a few with a very low 
required strength. By the twenty-eighth day, the majority of specimens had exceeded their required 
strength. Moreover, the concrete specimens continued to cure and exceed the required strength 
after the first twenty-eight days. Notably, we observed that for specimens with the largest required 
strength (12,000 PSI), the diagonal line passed through the mean of the measured strength on the 
28th-day plot. Furthermore, any specimen with a lower measured strength than the mean was not 
qualified. This indicates that even though the majority of the concrete specimens exceeded the 
required strength in the first twenty-eight days, specimens with higher required strength need to 
be allowed to continue curing beyond the twenty-eighth day to ensure their quality.

In order to gain deeper insights into the performance of specimens with varying required 
strengths over time, we categorized the required strength into four bins. Subsequently, we plotted 
the ratio of Measured Strength to Required Strength against the Specimen Age for each bin. 
Considering that concrete samples tend to exhibit faster initial curing and slower later-stage curing, 
we employed logarithmic regression. To depict the trend, logarithmic regression lines were 
incorporated into the plot. As shown in Figure 6, specimens with required strength less than 10,000 
PSI exhibit similar behavior, with those in the 5001 to 7,000 PSI range curing the fastest. On the 
other hand, specimens with required strength higher than 10,000 PSI cure much slower and their 
measured-to-required strength ratios do not rise as high as the others. In the lower right plot, we 
observe that the majority of specimens in this required strength range do not reach the required 
strength until the fifth or sixth day (one standard deviation away from the mean). Therefore, concrete samples with a required strength higher than 10,000 PSI should be cured for at least 56 
days, or potentially longer, to ensure their quality before their application in construction.

Lastly, our analysis focused on the third most influential feature for predicting concrete 
strength, namely batch temperature. This feature denotes the temperature of the concrete specimen 
during the curing process. Figure 7 illustrates our findings, indicating that a higher batch 
temperature during the initial 14-day period is correlated with improved curing, as evidenced by 
the measured strength surpassing the required threshold.
However, beyond the first 14 days, this correlation ceases to hold true, with one exception: 
specimens with a required strength falling within the range of 5,001 to 7,000 PSI. Consequently, 
we recommend reducing the batch temperature for all specimens whose required strength falls 
outside of this range after the initial 14-day period, as this adjustment has the potential to enhance 
the measured strength. Currently, batch temperature manipulation involves the addition of hot 
water or ice, both of which may have a detrimental effect on the measured strength. Unfortunately, 
due to missing data regarding the amount of water added, our project was unable to explore the 
relationship between water added, batch temperature, and measured strength. To facilitate further 
investigation, we strongly recommend collecting information on water added, enabling a more 
comprehensive analysis of these interrelated factors in the future. Such an exploration will yield a 
more precise recommendation regarding batch temperature manipulation.


# 4. Conclusion
This project has helped DCE overcome their data storage, retrieval, and analysis
challenges. Initially, DCE stored their concrete strength test reports stored in PDF files on a shared 
drive, which made it difficult for their engineers to retrieve the data and impossible to conduct data 
analysis. To address these issues, our team developed text scraper tools to extract the data from 
the PDF files and established a data schema to store the data in a structured format, for improved
data storage and retrieval.
In addition, we have developed a predictive model for concrete strength using Artificial 
Neural Networksthat can potentially save DCE's engineers time, money, and efforts by estimating
concrete strength values without the need of conducting several strength measurement tests in the 
laboratories by various testing agencies. The model can be used to predict concrete strength for 
different batches with varying parameters, empowering engineers to adjust the curing process and 
enhance the overall quality of the concrete.
Finally, the plots we created provide key insights and advice on concrete curing. We 
analyzed the relationship between variables such as batch temperature, required strength, and 
specimen age and their impact on measured strength. Our findings suggest that reducing the batch 
temperature after the first 14 days for specimens with required strength above 5,000 PSI can 
potentially increase measured strength. This information can help DCE's engineers to adjust the 
curing process to improve the overall quality of their concrete.
Overall, the improved data management processes and machine learning models we 
developed have the potential to revolutionize the construction industry by providing engineers with 
accurate predictions and insights on concrete strength and curing processes.
